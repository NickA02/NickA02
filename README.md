## Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!
### About Me
My name is Nicholas Almy, a first year graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I've been in chapel hill for four and a half years now, having completed my bachelor's degree with distinction in May of this year. 

Currently, I am working as a TA for the course COMP 455: Models of languages and computation, and I am looking to gain industry experience in software development, computer vision, and AI domains. 

Aside from software development, I enjoy being traveling, sports, and quality time with those I care about. 

### What you'll find here
Recently I have worked on a couple of projects that I am really proud of. First, my team and I built the first iteration of a coding platform, much like leetcode and gradescope, that lets students work on and submit solutions for coding challenges for Virginia Science olympiad events. You will also find that I worked on a few projects regarding viewing and manipulating NFL sports video for coaches analysis. Lastly, you will find various repositories where I have investigated the usefulness of LLMs in various settings (Summarization (Spring 2022), Cognitive Distortion Detection (Fall 2024)). 

### Personal Goals
I'm driven by a desire to learn, tinker, and problem solve -- that is what led me to computer science in the first place. Further, I think that the manipulation and usefulness of image and video data is very interesting. That is why, I think, my favorite projects to work on are computer vision driven (As you can see through some of my projects). I also have a deep interest in backend development, large language models, and data engineering, which is where the bulk of my studying has been.

Have a good day!
